  <p class="text">Marie Curie (1867–1934) was a pioneering physicist and chemist, best known for her groundbreaking research on radioactivity. Born Maria Skłodowska in Warsaw, Poland (then part of the Russian Empire), Curie moved to Paris in her early twenties to pursue higher education. Despite facing financial hardship, she studied at the Sorbonne (now part of the University of Paris) and earned degrees in physics and mathematics.

    In 1895, Curie married Pierre Curie, a fellow physicist, and they began collaborating on research. Together, they discovered the elements polonium and radium, and coined the term "radioactivity" to describe the phenomenon they observed. Their work laid the foundation for the field of nuclear physics and earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903, making Curie the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.
    
    After Pierre's tragic death in 1906, Marie Curie continued her research and became the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. In 1911, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of radium and polonium and her contributions to the understanding of radioactivity.
    
    Throughout her career, Curie faced significant challenges as a woman in the male-dominated scientific community, but she persevered and became one of the most celebrated scientists of her time. Her work not only advanced our understanding of the fundamental nature of matter but also paved the way for important medical applications of radioactivity, such as cancer treatment.
    
    Marie Curie's legacy continues to inspire scientists and women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields around the world. She remains an iconic figure in the history of science, revered for her intellect, determination, and groundbreaking contributions to humanity.</p>
